# Vivien's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Not the best one can find but at least I tried to take *from* the best here on github. They're meant to be a reliable tool to simplify install and moreover configuration process.

## Install

Install Command Line Tools without Xcode
`xcode-select --install`

Or, alternatively, install XCode from Mac App Store, and the Command Line Tools from the preferences.

Then you can clone the Dotfiles repository in your User folder:

`git clone https://github.com/viviengarcia/Dotfiles.git ~/Git/Dotfiles`

Launching the script is as simple as:

`source ~/Git/Dotfiles/install.sh`
